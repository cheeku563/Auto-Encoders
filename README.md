# classification of skin cancer images using pretrained layers of autoencoders

Autoencoders are a very good classifiers when it comes to classifing medical images as datasets are very small there is a significant advantage of using its pretrained layers as it is a unsupervised learning.

# usage

# how far can an auto encoder regenerate images?

For this cifar-10 is considered and trained for Epochs = 100,batch size = 250,learning rate= 0.00001,Adams optimizer
